# File Hash VSC Extension

Allows you to obtain the Hash string (sha256) of a file, also cleans line breaks before obtaining it.

To obtain the hash of a document, you must right-click on the file, either in the editor or in the explorer, and select one of the two options:

* Get File Hash
* Remove Line Breaks And Get File Hash

The hash will be copied to the clipboard so you can paste it wherever you want.
